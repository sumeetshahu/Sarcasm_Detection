# Sarcasm_Detection

<b>Introduction </b> <br>
Sarcasm is a sharp and ironic utterance designed to cut or to cause pain and  is often used to express strong emotions, such as contempt, mockery or bitterness. A sarcastic statement usually has positive words to convey a negative sentiment and is broadly adopted in social media and daily conversations.
Sarcasm detection is a very narrow research field in NLP, a specific case of sentiment analysis where instead of detecting a sentiment in the whole spectrum, the focus is on sarcasm. However, the task of sarcasm detection is much more difficult than sentiment analysis due to the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Unlike sentiment analysis where the sentiment categories are very clearly defined (love objectively has a positive sentiment, hate a negative sentiment no matter who you ask or what language you speak), the borders of sarcasm aren’t that well defined. </li>
<li> Sarcasm varies through person to person and is highly dependent on the culture, gender and many other aspects. Americans and Indians for example, perceive sarcasm differently. </li>
<li> Someone being sarcastic doesn’t mean the other person perceiving it as the speaker intended. Due to this subjectivity, even humans find it difficult at times to detect if someone is being sarcastic or not. </li>
</ul>
Sarcasm detection is of great importance in understanding people’s true sentiments and opinions. Application of sarcasm detection can benefit many areas of interest of NLP applications, including marketing research, opinion mining and information categorization.

<b> Business Problem </b> <br>
Develop a ML/DL model which performs as well as humans in identifying if a text/comment is sarcastic or not. <br>

<b> Deep Learning Problem </b> <br>
This is a binary classification problem where given a text, we have to predict if it’s sarcastic or not. <br>

<b> Dataset Overview </b> <br>

The data that will be used for this case study contains 1.3 million Sarcastic comments from the Internet commentary website Reddit. The dataset was generated by scraping comments from Reddit containing the \s ( sarcasm) tag by Mikhail Khodak and Nikunj Saunshi and Kiran Vodrahalli. This tag is often used by Redditors to indicate that their comment is in jest and not meant to be taken seriously, and is generally a reliable indicator of sarcastic comment content. <br>
